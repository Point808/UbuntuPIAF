Collection of scripts for use with Asterisk/PIAF/IncrediblePBX on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.  Some scripts are just modified Nerdvittles CentOS scripts, some are homebrew.  Will be adding more I have created later.
Forum thread: http://pbxinaflash.com/community/index.php?threads/wip-incrediblefax-for-ubuntu-incrediblepbx-install.15386/ 

Working: 
Ubuntu 14.04 (i386) and Ubuntu 14.04.1 (amd64) default installs per the NV post on Ubuntu and IncrediblePBX at (http://nerdvittles.com/?p=9713). 
Receiving faxes on multiple lines simultaneously (3 lines) 
Fax to email 
Fax categories and recipients in AvantFAX 
Outbound FAX via WebGUI 

Untested: 
Email to fax (send) 
Any custom destination or other advanced ways of receiving/sending 
Print to fax with any HylaFAX/AvantFAX addons 

Installation: 
1. Install Ubuntu 14.04 
2. Run through the IncrediblePBX (http://nerdvittles.com/?p=9713) install and reboot 
3. Login as root via SSH and run the PIAF updater when asked - this fixes a reboot and MySQL glitch. *YOU MUST REBOOT HERE* 
4. Install IncredibleFax, inserting your email address when requested. Press Enter for all other questions to accept the default options.

cd /root 
wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshnorth/UbuntuPIAF/master/incrediblefax11_ubuntu14.sh 
chmod +x incrediblefax11_ubuntu14.sh

*YOU MUST REBOOT HERE* 

Issues: 
1. Your default login should be admin/password. If you have problems with this, go to your root directory and run the following: 
''' 
./avantfax-pw-change
